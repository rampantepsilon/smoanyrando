<p>This is a SMO Moon Randomizer. This randomizer was created using the idea that JKTKops used in his <a href="https://github.com/JKTKops/Darker-Side-Randomizer">Darker Side Randomizer</a>. This randomizer produces a list of moons to obtain following some guidelines of the Any% or Festival% speedrun. These guidelines are as follows:
<ul>
<li>All Kingdom moons will be randomized up to the final story moon of the kingdom needed for progression. Sand, Metro (Any% Only), Snow, and Seaside do not have story moon requirements.</li>
<li>The amount of moons needed per kingdom will be the same as in the Any% or Festival% route. Meaning if the kingdom needs 5 moons, the randomizer will only produce 5 moons to obtain.</li>
<li>Shop and Slots Moons are included. However, costume moons are excluded to keep from increasing the time for runs greatly. (Possibly will add to the Long Randomizer at a later date.)
<li>Moons way out of the way are not included. This cuts down Seaside drastically unless Long Randomizer is selected.
</ul>
As time progresses and feedback comes in from the randomizer, more stipulations may occur for selection of moons.</p>
<p>Future Plans for the Randomizer (Note all versions listed are planned not actual releases)
<ul>
<li>Adding a short/long race mode. This would enable moons that may make races longer or shorter. [Beta run in v2.1.0]</li>
<li>Update Notifications to let players know when a new release is live. (Completed as of 3/24/19/Modified on 4/18/19)</li>
<li>Simpler seed sharing (Current seed count is a 100-character hash) [Planned Post 2.x.x]</li>
<li><a href="https://smorando.rampantepsilon.site">Web-based Randomizer</a> (Completed as of 3/25/19)</li>
<li>Add Support for sharing seeds via URL & allowing URLs to be inputted into the app (TBC by v2.0.1 release)</li>
<li>Support for other run styles (Festival% [Completed as of v2.0.0], Dark Side [v3.x.x], Darker Side [v3.x.x], World Peace [v2.1.0])</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Source Installation</p>
<p>If you want to install this randomizer from the source code, be careful as this source code may be on a newer version than release due to upcoming changes. This can mean that seeds will not be able to be shared properly. If you are fine with this, follow the instructions below:
<ul>
<li>Download the source code zipped folder</li>
<li>Extract files in desired location</li>
<li>In terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder with the files you just extracted</li>
<li>Run the command 'npm install'</li>
<li>Once the dependencies are installed, run 'npm start' to start the randomizer</li>
</ul>
</p>
