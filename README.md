<h3>Super Mario Odyssey Any% Moon Randomizer</h3>
<p>This is a SMO Any% Moon Randomizer. This randomizer produces a list of moons to obtain following some guidelines of the Any% speedrun. These guidelines are as follows:
<ul>
<li>All Kingdom moons will be randomized up to the final story moon of the kingdom.</li>
<li>The amount of moons needed per kingdom will be the same as in the Any% route. Meaning if the kingdom needs 5 moons, the randomizer will only produce 5 moons to obtain.</li>
</ul>
As time progresses and feedback comes in from the randomizer, more stipulations may occur for selection of moons.</p>
<p>Future Plans for the Randomizer
<ul>
<li>Adding a short/long race mode. This would enable moons that may make races longer or shorter.</li>
<li>Update Notifications to let players know when a new release is live. (Completed as of 3/24/19)</li>
<li>Simpler seed sharing (Current seed count is a 100-character hash)</li>
<li><a href="https://smorando.rampantepsilon.site">Web-based Randomizer</a> (Completed as of 3/25/19)</li>
<li>Support for other run styles (Festival%, Dark Side, Darker Side, World Peace)</li>
</ul>
